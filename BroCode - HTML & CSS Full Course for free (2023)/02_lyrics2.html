        [Verse 1: Blaster]
        I love you
        But I don't really show you
        I'd call you
        But only if you want me too
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Blaster]
        Oh, don't you let it stop
        Oh, I won't let it happen, baby
        I will never stop
        But only if you listen to me
        
        [Chorus: All]
        Come inside of my heart
        If you're looking for answers
        Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh
        Come inside of my heart
        If you're looking for answers
        Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh
        
        [Verse 2: Blaster]
        Oh, baby
        Forgive me if I hurt you
        Come save me
        'Cause you're the only one for me

        [Pre-Chorus: Blaster]
        Oh, don't you let it stop
        Oh, I won't let it happen, baby
        I will never stop
        But only if you listen to me
        
        [Chorus: All]
        Come inside of my heart
        If you're looking for answers
        Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh
        Come inside of my heart
        If you're looking for answers
        Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh
        
        [Bridge: Zild]
        Whatever happens to me, baby
        I'm sorry
        No one could ever go my way
        
        [Breakdown: Blaster]
        I love you
        But I don't really show you
        
        [Chorus: All]
        Come inside of my heart
        If you're looking for answers
        Look at the stars, go a little bit faster
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh
        (Come inside of my heart, baby)
        Come inside of my heart (Come in my heart)
        If you're looking for answers
        Look at the stars, go a little bit faster (Come in my heart)
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh
