      Tell me something
      When the rain falls on my face
      How do you quickly replace it
      With a golden summer smile?

      Tell me something
      When I'm feelin' tired and afraid
      How do you know just what to say
      To make everything alright?

      I don't think that you even realize
      The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
      You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
      I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
      You can thank your stars all you want
      But I'll always be the lucky one

      Tell me something
      When I'm 'bout to lose control
      How do you patiently hold my hand
      And gently calm me down?

      Tell me something
      When you sing and when you laugh
      Why do I always photograph
      My heart flying way above the clouds?

      I don't think that you even realize
      The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
      You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
      I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
      You can thank your stars all you want
      But I'll always be the lucky one

      Whoa-oh-ooh, ooh
      Whoa-oh-ooh, ooh
      Whoa-oh-ooh, ooh, ooh

      I don't think that you even realize
      The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
      You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
      I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
      You can thank your stars all you want
      But I'll always be the lucky one
      
      You can thank your stars all you want
      But I'll always be the lucky one
      I'll always be the lucky one
      I'll always be the lucky one
